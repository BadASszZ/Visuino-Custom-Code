Includes = External library files should be listed here, for example like this:
#include <Firmata.h>


The "On Data" property under each Custom Code input pin = What code to run each time the input gets updated with a value.

Members = This is where you declare your variables and what type they are, for example like this
float AInput1;


On Execute = Otherwise called "void loop" in Arduino IDE.

On Init = Otherwise called "void setup" in Arduino IDE.

On Start = The first time it runs or when a clock trigger the Custom Code component.

On update Hardware = Every time the board goes through each I/O pin.



How to send value to a output from the Custom Code component:
Analog1.Send("insert any type of compatible value, or calculation");

The "Analog1" is the name of an output on the right side of the Custom Code component. For example "Outputs.Analog1".
